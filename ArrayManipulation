/*
 The issue with this code was that, the for loop was iterating from i=0 to i<=numbers.length. However, for i=5 there
exists no element in the fifth index posiiton in the array (since arraysare zero-indexed). Therefore, the code will give a 
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionk. The corrected code is implemenetd below.
