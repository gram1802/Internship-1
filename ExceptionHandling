/*
  In the second part of the code, the divide() method is called with arguments 10 and 0. The method will try and perform 10.0, 
  which is not defined and so an ArithmeticException is thrown. However, there is no try-catch block to catch this exception,
  so your program will terminate abruptly. The correct code is shown below.
